The Vision
==========

Twitter, Reddit, Medium, Instagram, YouTube are all broken because the content is trapped in the platform. This leads to censorship and controlled filter bubbles, reducing freedom of expression.

The solution is that rather than publishing to a platform controlled by a company, content should be published using a neutral permissionless protocol using decentralized technologies such as `Ethereum <https://ethereum.org/>`_ and `IPFS <https://ipfs.io/>`_.

By de-coupling publishing and consumption of content, developers are free to innovate and every user can choose the app or filter bubble they want. This freedom will lead to greater richness of online communities that are better able to attain the goal of empowering individuals through knowledge and understanding.

`MIX <https://www.mix-blockchain.org/>`_ is based on a clone of Ethereum, providing independence and a huge capacity increase over using the Ethereum main chain.
